# Legend-of-Zelda-10
EECS 494 game project: Zelda clone
I worked on the audio, art, and some of the enemies, designed and created an area of the dungeon, designed and made the final boss of the dungeon, and worked on some of the systems, such as the inventory and block puzzle mechanisms. Additionally, I did the entire UI and dialogue.
